# DRList (Diminishing Returns Database)

Library that contains (hopefully) the most up to date [diminishing returns](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Diminishing_returns) categorization. This is purely the diminishing return data itself with API's to determine if a spellID has a diminishing return, if it diminishes in PvE and the category it diminishes in.

**This addon is a fork/rewrite of [DRData-1.0.](https://www.wowace.com/projects/drdata-1-0) which seems to be abandoned.**
DRList is updated to seamlessly support both Classic, TBC and Retail World of Warcraft.

[API Documentation.](https://wardz.github.io/DRList-1.0/)

## Upgrading from DRData to DRList

- All occurances of `DRData` must be renamed to `DRList`.
- There's a new category added for Disarms, depending on how your addon is coded you might need to account for this. (In Classic/TBC there's several new categories added, check the [wiki](https://github.com/wardz/DRList-1.0/wiki/DR-Categories).)
- If you used to access the tables directly, you'll now need to add the current expansion as an extra table property.
  E.g `DRData.categoryNames` to `DRList.categoryNames.retail` or `DRList.categoryNames.classic`. The only exception for this is
  the spell list table. For API functions there should be no need for changes.
- Calls to `IterateProviders` must be replaced with `IterateSpellsByCategory`.  

## Manual Install

Installing from source/master is not guaranteed to work. You should download a packaged version here instead:

- [Curseforge Download](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/drlist-1-0)
- [Github Download](https://github.com/wardz/drlist/releases)
Unzip it into `WoW/Interface/AddOns/YourAddon/libs` and add an entry for it in your addon's .toc file. (See Example Usage).
You may also install it as a standalone addon by putting it directly in `WoW/Interface/AddOns/`. This is recommended when
forking the library or creating addon packs/plugins where multiple addons use the lib.

## Usage with BigWigs Packager

## Contributing

- [Submit a pull request.](https://github.com/wardz/DRList-1.0/pulls)
  I recommend creating a symlink between your WoW addons folder and `DRList-1.0/DRList-1.0/` when forking.
  Tests will be ran automatically on pull requests but you can also run them ingame by typing `/drlist`.
